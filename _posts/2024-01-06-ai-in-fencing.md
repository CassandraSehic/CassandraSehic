### Introduction: My Experience in the World of Fencing

Fencing has been a central part of my life for nearly a decade. It's shaped major decisions, including my choice of college, and has been a source of both joy and frustration. As a saber fencer, I've experienced the intense highs and lows of this sport.

### The Challenge of Refereeing in Fencing

One of the most challenging aspects of fencing is the inconsistency in refereeing, particularly in saber and foil disciplines. Gather a group of top-level referees to watch the same match, and you're likely to hear a variety of opinions. This inconsistency is rooted in the sport's evolving, often unwritten rules. What's more, refereeing styles have significant geographic distinctions, adding another layer of complexity. American and European referees, for instance, have distinct approaches, yet both officiate at international competitions.

### The Issue of Referee Corruption
Another concern is the potential for referee corruption. Given the sport's inherent ambiguity, referees wield considerable influence over match outcomes. Subtle biases can be hard to detect, making it challenging to address this issue effectively. High-level fencing does allow for video reviews of contentious points, but this only partially addresses the problem.

### AI: A Potential Game-Changer for Fencing
Enter Artificial Intelligence (AI), a transformative force across various sectors. In fencing, AI could revolutionize how matches are refereed, ensuring consistency and fairness. Imagine training with AI referees in your club and facing the same digital officiating in competitions. This technology could eliminate corruption and standardize rule interpretation globally.

### Community Resistance and the Path Forward
Despite its potential, integrating AI into fencing won't be without challenges. Skeptics may question the data used to train these models and the inherent biases they might contain. Creating a universally accepted AI model is a tall order, but it's a step towards a more equitable and transparent sport.

### Resistance from Referees: The Job Security Concern
In addition to skepticism about data and potential biases, another significant hurdle in integrating AI into fencing is the resistance from the referees themselves. The introduction of AI referees could be seen as a direct threat to their livelihoods. For many, refereeing is not just a role but a career that they have cultivated over years, if not decades. The prospect of being replaced by an AI system could lead to substantial pushback from this community.

### The Power Dynamics in Fencing
Moreover, it's important to recognize the complex power dynamics at play within the fencing community. Frequently, individuals in positions of authority, capable of influencing the adoption of AI in sports, are also those who might benefit from or even intentionally contribute to the sport's inconsistencies. This conflict of interest could be a significant barrier to the implementation of AI refereeing.

### Navigating the Transition to AI
Addressing these concerns will require a thoughtful and inclusive approach. It's crucial to engage with referees and other stakeholders in the fencing community to explore how AI can complement, rather than replace, human referees. Perhaps AI could be used as a tool for training and assisting referees, rather than as a complete substitute. This approach could help preserve jobs while still improving the fairness and consistency of refereeing.

### Enhancing Spectator Experience
AI could also make fencing more spectator-friendly. Slow-motion replays with animated lines and expert commentary could demystify the sport, making it more accessible and enjoyable for audiences. This approach has been successful in other sports and could significantly boost fencing's appeal. There has already been some exploration into this. Notably, a project called Fencing Visualized by Dentsu Lab Tokyo has been making great strides [here](https://dentsulab.tokyo/en/works/fencingvisualized).

### Leveraging Technology for a Better Future in Fencing
With the increasing accessibility of machine learning, it's a great time for this transformation. By harnessing extensive video archives of past matches, we can train sophisticated AI models to serve as fair and consistent referees.

### Conclusion: Embracing AI for the Future of Fencing
In sum, the integration of AI into fencing is a complex issue that extends beyond technical challenges. It involves addressing the concerns of referees about job security, navigating the existing power structures within the sport, and finding a balance that respects the roles of human referees while leveraging the benefits of AI. With a collaborative and sensitive approach, it's possible to harness AI's potential to enhance the sport of fencing, making it more fair and enjoyable for everyone involved.
