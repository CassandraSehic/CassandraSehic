Have you ever met that kid that keeps asking "Why?"

MOM: "You can't play in the park today."

KID: "Why?"

MOM: "Because its storming outside."

KID: "Why?"

MOM: "Because we live Florida."

KID: "Why?"

MOM: "Because there is no state income tax, and your dad got a job here."

KID: "Why?"

MOM: *Sigh*

Even children seem to intuitively grasp the infinite chain of causality that unfolds before us. One of my earliest memories revolves around this very realization: "If everything is a result of a preceding cause, and that preceding cause is also a result of another cause, what do I genuinely control?" This revelation haunted me throughout my formative years.

The feeling of helplessness worsened when I learned in school about the distinct brain structures of psychopaths, identifiable through brain scans. I wondered, "If a psychopath has no say over their brain's malformation, how can they be blamed for heinous acts like murder? Should anyone truly be held accountable for their actions?" When I tried sharing these thoughts with peers and teachers, I was immediately shut down, so I had to turn to the family computer room for answers.

After fumbling through words to describe the concept, Google eventually presented [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) to me. To my astonishment, a considerable number of thinkers throughout history appeared to favor determinism, including names like Democritus, Hobbes, and Laplace (whom I naively thought I had left behind Differential Equations). I found physicists and philosophers who so eloquently talked about the subject, that I was drawn in deeper. One of the most enjoyable speakers I've found on the topic is [Sabine Hossenfelder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI5FMj5D9zU). As I watched debates on free will versus determinism, I observed that many who defended "free will" were actually championing the _belief_ in free will—a distinction that's crucial. As I delved in EVEN FURTHER, my perspective shifted toward [indeterminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminism). Basically, I maintained my skepticism of free will, but now posited that not all events are predetermined and that instead, some events, especially in the realm of quantum mechanics, are random. I am no physicist, but I had become much more researched on the subject than the average college gal, yet, the more I learned, the more helpless I felt.

To say I struggled with this, would be an oversimplification. I fixated on it too much. The English language seems ill-equipped to capture the paradox of consciously recognizing one's own lack of free will, so I'll spare most of the details. Just know that it sparked intense internal conflicts like: "If one truly believes they lack free will, why should they bother doing anything if it's all predetermined?" But, the act of pondering this or choosing inaction is, is a form of action, which was also.. predertermined. Shit."

The purpose of this post is not to convince anyone that they do not have free will. Instead, I want to share another revelation: it doesn't truly matter. Whether we possess free will shouldn't concern us because it's not how we experience the world. Consider the chair you're sitting on—it's mostly empty space (mostly being [99.9999999% empty space!](https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/matter-mostly-empty-space/). Yet, you perceive it as solid and tangible. The chair's emptiness doesn't affect your daily life. Similarly, our perception of free will shouldn't plunge us into existential despair. We experience life as if we have agency, and that's what truly matters. This isn't to say that I think people should avoid the topic of free will and determinism, I still find it very intriguing and worthy of discussion. However, trying to take advantage of the knowlege that you do not have free will is futile. So, I hold that we shouldn't sit on our empty chairs and hope we were lucky enough to have been gifted great lives by the universe... instead we should go out, make decisions, and demand it for ourselves!
