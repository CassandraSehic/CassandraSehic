What is the longest amount of time you were able to keep a diary? I'd be impressed if you said three months. I'd be even more impressed if you looked back at old diary entries and didn't feel at least a twinge of embarrasment. 

I was inspired to write this post because I found an old diary entry from 2008 :(

The traditional diary method was not for me, so don't expect this post to tell you how to maintain a long cringeless diary (if you know how to do this, my inbox is open). However, I can understand the appeal of having something that allows you to revisit your life experiences and emotions, and I suspect I'm not the only one, based on how long-lasting and widespread the concept of a diary is. 

### The Alternative
September 2023 marks exactly three years of me keeping an alternative style diary, which I call a "music diary." The name is as simple as the concept. Naturally, I listen to music, and naturally, the music I listen to changes over time. At the beginning of each month, I create a new playlist titled the current month and year (Example: October_2023). Then, throughout the month, I add to the playlist whatever songs I'm liking and repeatedly listing to. I was not anticipating the great results.

### What I discovered:
1. Even if the music I listen to doesn't match how I am feeling that month, true memories and emotions will be linked to those songs. Example: Apparently, I was listening to ["I Was Made for Lovin' You" by KISS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWEBmwRYRVM) during a breakup. Strange but true.
   
2. Each month of my life is completely different. Without reflecting on the past, its difficult to recognize how much I change each month. Four weeks is a long time!
   
3. Keeping a music diary has has helped my memory, especially sequential memory, tremendously. My life and the sequence of events that it consist of seem a lot more orderly in my head than they used to be.

### Try it!
Really, the main benefit I have gained from keeping this style of diary is the ability to click a few buttons and revisit a month in my life. The memories come flickering back almost like I've set up a little projector in my brain. I'd love to see the music diaries of other and I'd encourage anyone to give it a try. It costs nothing, is super easy, and provided at least one person incredible benefits. Another huge benefit I can't forget to mention is the privacy and security of a music diary. If a strange music taste is the worst someone can get on me, I'll proudly keep my music diary open for public viewing.
