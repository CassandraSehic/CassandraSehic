What is the longest amount of time you were able to consistantly keep a diary? I'd be impressed if you said three months. I'd be even more impressed if you looked back at old diary entries and didn't feel at least a twinge of embarrasment. 

I was inspired to write this post because I found an old diary entry from 2008 :(

Needless to say, the traditional diary method is not for me, so don't expect this post to tell you how to maintain a cringeless diary for the rest of your life (if you know how to do this, my inbox is open). However, I can understand the appeal of having something that allows you to revisit your life experiences and emotions, and I suspect I'm not the only one based on how long-lasting and widespread the concept of a diary is. 

September 2023 marks exactly three years of me keeping an alternative style diary, which I call a "music diary." The name is as simple as the concept. Naturally, I listen to music, and naturally, the music I listen to changes over time. At the beginning of each month, I create a new playlist titled the current month and year. Then, throughout the month, I add to the playlist whatever songs I'm liking and repeatedly listing to. I was not anticipating the great results.

What I discovered:
1. Each month of my life is completely different, even if I feel like I am doing the same things.
2. Even if the music I listen to doesn't match how I am feeling that month, true memories and emotions will be linked to those songs. Example: Apparently, I was listening to "I Was Made for Lovin' You" by KISS during a breakup. 
3. Keeping a music diary has has helped my memory, especially sequential memory, tremendously. My life and the sequence of events that it consist of seem a lot more orderly in my head than they used to be.

Really, the main benefit I have gained from keeping this style of diary is the ability to click a few buttons and revisit a month in my life and let memories come pouring back almost like I've set up a little projector in my brain. I also can't forget to mention the privacy and security benefits of this diary style. Nobody can read my secrets like they could if they found a paper diary. Thank god. If a strange music taste  is the worst can get, I'll proudly keep my music diary open for public viewing. You can visit it here: https://open.spotify.com/user/sehiccn?si=6819400a98b64de7
