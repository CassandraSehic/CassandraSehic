In the annals of ancient history, the Canaanite deity, [Moloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch), was said to offer a grotesque bargain: the sacrifice of children by fire, for the promise of power and victory. This barbaric practice, while horrifying, is not as distant from our modern world as we might like to think. Today, Moloch's legacy persists, not in the form of physical offerings, but in the metaphorical ones we make in the name of competition.

Moloch is emblematic of poorly designed games, systems where the incentives are so misaligned that they create lose-lose situations. In the pursuit of a temporary advantage, much is often sacrificed. This concept can be examined further in the realms of media, social interaction, environmental crises, and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence.

Before delving deeper into these modern manifestations of Moloch, it is crucial to clarify that competition and capitalism are not problematic in and of themsleves. Indeed, these systems have solved many problems and driven remarkable progress. However, when these systems function in way in which we are all [racing towards the bottom](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/race-bottom.asp), cooperation becomes vital to prevent outcomes that echo sacrifices made to Moloch.

Consider the media landscape. The quest for views has birthed a Moloch in the form of sensationalist, click-bait journalism. The most outrageous, anger-inducing headlines thrive, often at the expense of truth and nuance. This environment leads to negative dispositions, distrust, and massive [perception gaps](https://perceptiongap.us/), as the incentive to attract immediate attention and appease investors outweighs the journalistic integrity of providing true, balanced reporting. The sacrifice here is the public's trust and accurate widespread information, for the fleeting power of high engagement metrics.

In the influencer-centric social media landscape, the pursuit of likes and followers often leads to significant personal sacrifices. Privacy is frequently the first casualty, as individuals share more and more private aspects of their lives for online validation. This environment also takes a toll on mental health, with constant exposure to others' idealized online personas leading to feelings of inadequacy. The situation is exacerbated by the prevalence of beauty filters and photo editing, which make unrealistic appearance standards the new norm. Edited photos typically garner more engagement, and as many influencers use them, not editing your photos can put you at a disadvantage rather than offering the edge it used to. This creates a vicious cycle where the use of such enhancements is no longer a choice but a necessity for maintaining online relevance. Moreover, these platforms are designed to prioritize engagement, often at the expense of user well-being. The algorithms that drive these sites reward content that keeps users scrolling, clicking, and interacting, regardless of the impact on their mental health. As a result, the platforms profit from increased user engagement, with little incentive to address the negative consequences of this system. We end up sacrificing genuine human connections for the transient satisfaction of "influencing."

Extending this metaphor, arms races and environmental crises present similar Moloch-like scenarios. Nations or corporations engage in perpetual escalation, each striving to outdo the other in military or technological capabilities. This is a classic example of a lose-lose situation. The resources expended in this relentless competition could be directed towards more constructive ends. Yet, the fear of being outpaced fuels continuous investment in armaments, leading to a situation where all parties are worse off than if they had cooperated. Environmental crises, such as the tragedy of the commons, where individual entities exploit shared resources to the point of depletion, mirror the sacrifices made to Moloch. Each entity acts in its self-interest, but the collective impact of these actions leads to environmental degradation, affecting everyone negatively. This short-sighted pursuit of individual gain at the expense of the greater good requires a level of altruism and foresight that is often at odds with individualistic and immediate gains.

The realm of artificial intelligence (AI) development is particularly susceptible to Moloch-like scenarios. At this moment, there is a relentless race to develop and deploy AI technologies. Companies are driven by the fear of being left behind, leading to a rush in AI development without adequate consideration of ethical implications, long-term societal impacts, or safety protocols. This race, fueled by short-term gains and competitive pressures, could lead to disastrous consequences, both unintended and unforeseen.

In each of these scenarios, the metaphor of Moloch serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of misaligned incentives and short-sighted goals. The challenge lies in changing the game, so that weare not motivated by shitty incentives. This requires a reevaluation of our priorities and the systems that govern our actions. It demands a level of introspection and foresight, a willingness to look beyond immediate gains and consider the long-term impacts of our actions.
