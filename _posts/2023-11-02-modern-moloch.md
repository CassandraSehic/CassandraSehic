In the annals of ancient history, the Canaanite deity, [Moloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch), was said to offer a grotesque bargain: the sacrifice of children by fire, for the promise of power and victory. This barbaric practice, while horrifying, is not as distant from our modern world as we might like to think. Today, Moloch's legacy persists, not in the form of physical sacrifices, but in the metaphorical ones we make in the name of competition.

Moloch is emblematic of poorly designed games, systems where the incentives are so misaligned that they create lose-lose situations. In the pursuit of a temporary advantage, much is often sacrificed. This concept can be examined further in the realms of media, social interaction, arms races, environmental crises, and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence.

Before delving deeper into these modern manifestations of Moloch, it is crucial to clarify that competition and capitalism are not problematic in and of themsleves. Indeed, these systems have solved many problems and driven remarkable progress. However, when the game is poorly designed, with misaligned incentives, it is then that cooperation is neccessary to veer us away from destructive outcomes, reminiscent of the sacrifices made to Moloch.

Consider the media landscape. The quest for views has birthed a Moloch in the form of sensationalist, click-bait journalism. The most outrageous, anger-inducing headlines thrive, often at the expense of truth and nuance. This environment breeds distrust and [perception gaps](https://perceptiongap.us/), as the incentive to attract immediate attention outweighs the journalistic integrity of providing true, balanced reporting. The sacrifice here is the public's trust and accurate widespread information, offered up for the fleeting power of high engagement metrics.

In the influencer age, social media represents another modern-day Moloch. Here, the pursuit of likes and followers can lead to significant sacrifices. Personal privacy is often the first to be relinquished, as individuals share increasingly intimate details of their lives for online validation. Mental health is another casualty in this scenario. The constant comparison to the carefully curated lives of others can lead to feelings of inadequacy. Similarly, beauty filters and photo editing tools has created an unattainable ideal of physical appearance. The constant comparison to these digitally altered images can lead to a distorted body image, essentially training you to dislike your unedited self. The algorithms that drive these platforms prioritize engagement (and unfortunately edited versions of ourselves perform better online), creating echo chambers that distort our perception of reality. We sacrifice meaningful connection on the altar of social media engagement.

Extending this metaphor, arms races and environmental crises present similar Moloch-like scenarios. Nations or corporations engage in perpetual escalation, each striving to outdo the other in military or technological capabilities. This is a classic example of a lose-lose situation. The resources expended in this relentless competition could be directed towards more constructive ends. Yet, the fear of being outpaced fuels continuous investment in armaments, leading to a situation where all parties are worse off than if they had cooperated. Environmental crises, such as the tragedy of the commons, where individual entities exploit shared resources to the point of depletion, mirror the sacrifices made to Moloch. Each entity acts in its self-interest, but the collective impact of these actions leads to environmental degradation, affecting everyone negatively. This short-sighted pursuit of individual gain at the expense of the greater good requires a level of altruism and foresight that is often at odds with individualistic and immediate gains.

The realm of artificial intelligence (AI) development is particularly susceptible to Moloch-like scenarios. In the corporate world, there is a relentless race to develop and deploy AI technologies. Companies are driven by the fear of being left behind, leading to a rush in AI development without adequate consideration of ethical implications, long-term societal impacts, or safety protocols. This race, fueled by short-term gains and competitive pressures, could lead to disastrous consequences, both unintended and unforeseen.

In each of these scenarios, the metaphor of Moloch serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of misaligned incentives and short-sighted goals. The challenge lies in changing the game, so that weare not motivated by shitty incentives. This requires a reevaluation of our priorities and the systems that govern our actions. It demands a level of introspection and foresight, a willingness to look beyond immediate gains and consider the long-term impacts of our actions.
