Hello, my name is Cassie Sehic. I've created this site to showcase some of my personality to future friends and employers. I make blog posts of whatever happens to cross my mind, showoff my personal projects, and store some photos and art here. I hope you enjoy what you see!

### More About Me

I am a finance and technology student! I graduated from [NJIT](https://www.njit.edu/) in Spring 2023 with a B.S. in Information Technology and Web Applications. Currently, I am pursuing an M.B.A. in Finance at [Wagner College](https://wagner.edu/), and am set to graduate in Spring 2025. During my undergrad, I was a member of NJIT's Division I Fencing Team, and I now serve as the Wagner Men's and Women's Division I [Assistant Fencing Coach](https://wagnerathletics.com/news/2023/8/21/mens-fencing-cassandra-sehic-named-fencing-graduate-assistant-coach.aspx), while simultaneuosly attending school and working part-time as a cloud finance research analyst. 

Some of my interests include philosophy, game theory, artificial intelligence, sports psychology, and economics. I am certainly not an expert in any of these fields, but love to discuss them with others, and many of the writings you will find on this site likely relate to one or more of these areas. I also love art, whether that be digital fashion, music, crafting, writing, cooking, etc. I do a little of everything.

### What About Future Me?

While I might not have a precise vision of where I'll be in ten years, I'm certain about one thing: the "where" matters more to me than the "what." Every organization needs a researcher, financial analyst, or developer, but I'm drawn to businesses with compelling, intriguing goals. I want to not just be a part of such organizations but to actively contribute to achieving their objectives. My belief is firm: I can learn anything I set my mind to. This conviction is backed by the diverse set of skills I've acquired in the tech and finance sectors through my [past work experiences](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cassandrasehic/), academic pursuits, and personal endeavors. I'm on the lookout for exceptional opportunities, and ready to invest my passion and effort wholeheartedly.
